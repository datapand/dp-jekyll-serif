At Datapand, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect any information you provide through our website’s contact form and how we use analytics tools to enhance your experience on our site.

### Information We Collect

When you submit a contact form on our website, we collect the following personal information:
- Name
- Email address
- Any other information you choose to provide in your message

We collect this information solely to respond to your inquiries and provide the services or information you request.

### How We Use Your Information

The information you provide is used for the following purposes:
- To respond to your inquiries
- To provide you with relevant information about our services
- To communicate with you regarding your requests

We will not use your information for any marketing purposes unless you explicitly consent to receiving marketing communications.

### Third-Party Service Providers

Our contact form is provided by [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/), which may process your information according to its own privacy policy. We recommend reviewing [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)'s [terms of service](https://formspree.io/legal/terms-of-service/) and [privacy policy](https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy/) for more information on how your data is handled.

This website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). By using this website, you acknowledge and agree that GitHub Pages may collect and process your data in accordance with their own privacy policy and terms of service. We do not have control over the data that GitHub Pages may collect or how it is used. For more information, please review the [GitHub Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) and [GitHub Pages Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service).

### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to collect and analyze information about how visitors use our website. Google Analytics helps us understand trends and improve user experience on our site. The data collected includes, but is not limited to:
- Pages visited
- Time spent on each page
- Device and browser type
- Geographic location (based on IP address, anonymized)
  
Google Analytics collects this information using cookies, which are text files placed on your device. The information generated by these cookies is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. 

However, we have enabled IP anonymization in Google Analytics, meaning your IP address is truncated before being sent to Google. This ensures that the data collected cannot be traced back to any individual.

For more information about how Google handles the data it collects, please review the [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

If you prefer, you can opt out of Google Analytics by using the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### Data Protection

We take the security of your personal information seriously. We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information you provide from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

### Sharing Your Information

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may only share your information if required by law or if necessary to protect our legal rights.

### Retention of Information

We will retain the information you provide through the contact form only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or as required by law.

### Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access the personal information we hold about you
- Request corrections or updates to your information
- Request deletion of your personal information

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [info@datapand.com](mailto:info@datapand.com).

### Cookies

Our website uses cookies for Google Analytics to collect anonymized data about how visitors interact with the site. You can adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please note that disabling cookies may affect the functionality of the website.
